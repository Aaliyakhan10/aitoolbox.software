## How to Contribute

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to contribute to AIToolbox:

1.  **Find an Issue:**
    *   Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/amanraj1602/aitoolbox.software/issues) for open issues that you can work on.
    *   Comment on the issue to let others know you're interested in working on it.
    *   If no issue exists for your contribution, create one describing the bug or feature you want to address.

2.  **Get Assigned:**
    *   Wait for a maintainer to assign the issue to you. This helps prevent multiple people from working on the same thing simultaneously.

3.  **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
    *   Fork the repository on GitHub.
    *   Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/aitoolbox.software.git
        cd aitoolbox.software
        ```
    *   Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
        ```bash
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/huamanraj/aitoolbox.software.git
        ```
    *   Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
        ```bash
        git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
        ```

4.  **Make Changes:**
    *   Implement your feature or bug fix.
    *   Follow the project's coding style and guidelines.
    *   Write clear, concise, and well-commented code.

5.  **Test Your Changes:**
    *   Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce any new issues.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    *   Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "feat: Add your feature"
        ```

7.  **Push Your Changes:**
    *   Push your branch to your forked repository:
        ```bash
        git push origin feature/your-feature-name
        ```

8.  **Create a Pull Request:**
    *   Go to the original repository on GitHub.
    *   Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
    *   Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.
    *   Reference the issue your pull request resolves (e.g., `Closes #123`).

9.  **Code Review:**
    *   Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request.
    *   Address any feedback or comments from the maintainer.
    *   Make changes and push them to your branch, which will automatically update the pull request.

10. **Merge:**
    *   Once your pull request has been approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality

*   **Readability & Scalability:** Write code that is clean, readable, and scalable. Follow the existing architectural patterns and conventions used throughout the project.
*   **Consistency:** Adhere to the existing coding style and structure. Your code should feel like it was written by the same person who wrote the rest of the codebase.

### Theme and Design

*   **Consistency is Key:** All UI/UX changes must align with the existing design and theme of the application. New components should be visually consistent with existing ones.
