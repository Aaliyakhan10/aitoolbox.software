# SEO & Google AdSense Guide for Next.js AI Tools App

* **Unique page titles & meta tags:** Use Next.js’s `<Head>` to add a descriptive `<title>` and meta description on every page.  *Do:* Give each tool its own title (e.g. “AI Email Writer – YourSiteName”) and relevant description. *Don’t:* leave titles blank or duplicate them across pages. *Use case:* On the “AI Email Writer” page, set `<title>AI Email Writer – My AI Toolbox</title>` and a meta description highlighting its features.
* **Rich, original content:** Ensure each tool’s page has substantial unique text. *Do:* Write helpful overviews and examples (hundreds of words) about the tool’s function. *Don’t:* publish mostly empty pages or copy content from elsewhere. *Use case:* The “AI Translator” page should include a paragraph explaining how translations are performed by AI, perhaps with example text, so it isn’t just a blank interface.
* **Structured data (JSON‑LD):** Add schema markup for your tools or articles to help Google understand and display them richer (e.g. `SoftwareApplication` or `FAQPage` schemas). *Do:* Include JSON-LD with the tool name, description, and logo. *Don’t:* skip structured data if relevant content is present. *Use case:* On the “Logo Generator” page, include JSON-LD indicating it’s a creative tool with its name and a brief description.

* **SSR/SSG rendering:** Pre-render pages with server-side or static generation for SEO. Static pages load faster and are fully crawlable, which helps SEO. *Do:* Use `getStaticProps`/`getStaticPaths` (or app-router equivalents) to generate each tool’s page at build time if data is known. *Don’t:* rely on only client-side rendering for content that search engines should index. *Use case:* For each AI tool page (like “Text Summarizer”), use Next.js static generation so Google can read its content.
* **Semantic HTML & headings:** Structure content with proper tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, etc.). *Do:* Use one `<h1>` per page (typically the tool’s name) and organize subsections with `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. *Don’t:* overload a page with many `<h1>`s or use headings purely for styling.
* **Mobile-friendly & performance:** Ensure the site is responsive and fast. *Do:* Test with Google’s mobile-friendly test and optimize Core Web Vitals (e.g. code-splitting, compressing assets). *Don’t:* ignore mobile layout (Google prioritizes mobile pages). *Use case:* Use responsive CSS and optimize fonts so that the “Resume Builder” tool page loads quickly on phones.
* **Clear site structure & navigation:** Provide an obvious menu or index for all tools and pages. *Do:* Link to each tool from a homepage or navigation bar. *Don’t:* bury tools behind unclear menus or require login to access content. *Use case:* Include a navbar listing all AI tools (Ask AIToolbox, Prompt Generator, etc.) so users and crawlers can find every page.
* **Enough high-quality text for Ads:** Google AdSense needs sufficient original text to determine relevancy. *Do:* Fill each page with complete sentences and useful content about the tool. *Don’t:* place AdSense code on pages that are “under construction” or mostly empty (only images/inputs). *Use case:* The “Blog Summarizer” page should have an explanatory intro paragraph before any ads.
* **No duplicate or scraped content:** Follow AdSense content rules – all text must be unique and user-oriented. *Do:* Provide original tool descriptions or commentary. *Don’t:* copy-paste from other websites or use spun content (Google calls that spam). *Use case:* If you explain how the AI Translator works, write it yourself or clearly cite sources; avoid simply regurgitating an AI’s output without context.
* **Privacy Policy and contact info:** Publish a clear Privacy Policy and contact page. AdSense **requires** a privacy policy disclosing third-party ads/cookies. *Do:* Add a “Privacy Policy” link in the footer explaining data use and ad networks. *Don’t:* skip it – missing privacy policy is a common disapproval reason.
* **AdSense policy compliance:** Ensure no prohibited content (adult, copyrighted, hate speech, etc.) appears. *Do:* Follow Google’s Publisher Policies, and moderate any user-generated content. *Don’t:* show ads on pages with disallowed material or on auto-generated/spammy pages. *Use case:* If you allow users to enter text (e.g. in the Ask AIToolbox), ensure nothing disallowed can be submitted or shown on an ad page.
* **Proper ad placement:** When approved, place AdSense code on pages with real content. *Do:* Insert ad code on pages with substantial content only. *Don’t:* put large ads above the fold that push content down (Google warns against content being “pushed below the fold”). *Use case:* Once approved, embed ads below the tool output or in a sidebar, not as the very first thing on the page.
