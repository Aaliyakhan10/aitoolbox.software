2.  **Code Quality:**
    *   **Readability & Scalability:** Write code that is clean, readable, and scalable. Follow the existing architectural patterns and conventions used throughout the project.
    *   **Consistency:** Adhere to the existing coding style and structure. Your code should feel like it was written by the same person who wrote the rest of the codebase.

3.  **Theme and Design:**
    *   **Consistency is Key:** All UI/UX changes must align with the existing design and theme of the application. New components should be visually consistent with existing ones.

4.  **Pull Requests (PRs):**
